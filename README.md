# Password-Generator
Randomly generates password based of citeria

## Description
This project was to build a random password generated. Due to the ongoing struggles to keep personal data secure a strong password is one of the first steps to stop people with malicious intent to hack into my personal accounts. This random password generated will help me keep a secure password with the ability to set on my own strength levels. This project is free for anyone to use so they themself can feel safe and protected from hackers.

## Reasoning Behind My Portfolio

* What was my motivation: The motivation for this project is to help keep my password secure to prevent hackers to grab my personal account data
* Why did you build this project: I wanted to challenge myself into creating my own password generated with the ability to create my own strength levels for a secure password/
* What problem does this solve: This project solves the problem of constantly coming up with secure password.
* What did I learn:  I learned how to collect data input by using alert/confirm/prompt and store that data to a variable. As well as convert characters to ASCII and vice versa.  And finally using Math.random I learned how to randomize value given an array and past data from JS to HTML.
